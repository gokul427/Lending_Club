# Lending_Club
EDA on Lending club case study.


Understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default,
i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

Observations and Suggestions:

As small business are defaulting more, provide loans with less interest rate.

Nebraska state has more defaulters, so be careful while granting loan.

People who have been verified are defaulting more, maybe verification process needs to be checked.

People who have taken high amount are defaulting slightly higher than low amount

People having higher interest rate have defaulted more than others

Loan applications are more in December or in Q4. Encourage people to take loans during other quarters.
